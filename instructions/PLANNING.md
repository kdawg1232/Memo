## üß≠ Project Overview
**Audio Geo-Pinning** is a location-based voice journaling app that lets users drop short audio memos at specific physical locations on a map. These memos are viewable and listenable by anyone who visits that spot virtually. It's like geocaching meets podcasting ‚Äî leave your thoughts, stories, or tips where they matter most.

## üéØ MVP Goals (24-Hour Build)
Build a minimum viable version that supports:
- Recording audio
- Pinning that audio to a live GPS location
- Viewing pins on a map
- Playing back audio from any pin
- Simple user authentication

## üì≤ Key Features
| Feature                | Description |
|------------------------|-------------|
| **Record Audio**       | Users can record short voice messages via their phone mic |
| **Pin to Location**    | After recording, the audio is geo-pinned to the user's current GPS location |
| **Map View**           | Shows user location and nearby audio pins |
| **Playback Pins**      | Users can tap pins and play audio in-app |
| **User Auth**          | Auth via email  |

## üõ† Tech Stack
| Layer       | Tool |
|-------------|------|
| Frontend    | React Native (Expo) |
| Maps        | `react-native-maps` |
| Audio       | `expo-av` |
| GPS         | `expo-location` |
| Backend     | Supabase (DB + Auth + Storage) |

## üóÑ Supabase Schema
### Table: `pins`
| Field      | Type     | Description                  |
|------------|----------|------------------------------|
| id         | uuid     | Primary key                  |
| user_id    | uuid     | Foreign key to auth.users    |
| lat        | float    | Latitude of pin              |
| lng        | float    | Longitude of pin             |
| audio_url  | text     | Link to audio file in storage|
| created_at | timestamp| Time pin was created         |

### Storage
- Bucket: `audio`
- Path: `/user_id/timestamp.m4a`

Colors Scheme: 

## Color Palette - Neutral Black & White Theme
Use the following neutral colors consistently across all UI elements for a clean, modern, minimalist aesthetic:

### Primary Colors
- `#000000` ‚Äì Pure Black (primary text, icons, emphasis, primary buttons)
- `#FFFFFF` ‚Äì Pure White (backgrounds, contrast elements, button text on black)
- `#2C2C2C` ‚Äì Charcoal (secondary text, subtle emphasis)
- `#F5F5F5` ‚Äì Light Gray (subtle backgrounds, dividers, inactive button backgrounds)
- `#808080` ‚Äì Medium Gray (inactive states, secondary text, disabled elements)
- `#404040` ‚Äì Dark Gray (borders, subtle contrasts, tertiary text)

### Usage Guidelines
- **Primary Actions**: Pure black (`#000000`) for maximum emphasis
- **Secondary Actions**: Dark gray (`#404040`) for moderate emphasis
- **Inactive/Disabled**: Medium gray (`#808080`) for reduced emphasis
- **Main Backgrounds**: Pure white (`#FFFFFF`) for clean, spacious feel
- **Subtle Backgrounds**: Light gray (`#F5F5F5`) for cards, sections, inactive areas
- **Borders/Dividers**: Light gray (`#F5F5F5`) for subtle separation
- **Text Hierarchy**: Black for primary, charcoal for secondary, dark gray for tertiary

### Design Principles
- Maintain excellent contrast ratios for accessibility
- Use opacity variations for hover/pressed states
- Rely on typography and spacing for visual hierarchy
- Keep the design timeless and professional

## üîö Success Criteria
By the end of 24 hours, the user should be able to:
- Open the app, see their location on a map
- Record and upload a voice memo
- See a pin dropped where they recorded it
- Tap the pin to hear the audio
- View other pins within a short distance
- Sign in 

Let me know if you'd like to extend this to v2 features like comments, privacy controls, pin filtering, or social discovery.
