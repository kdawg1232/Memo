- [x] Upload the recorded audio file to Supabase storage under path `user_id/timestamp.m4a`
- [x] Get a public URL of the uploaded file
- [x] Save a new row in `pins` table with `user_id`, `lat`, `lng`, `audio_url`, and `created_at`
- [x] Implement createAudioPin function with full upload workflow
- [x] Add audio file cleanup on database errors

---

### 🗺️ PIN LOGIC + PLAYBACK (12–16 hrs) ✅ COMPLETE
- [x] On recording complete + upload, drop a marker on the map at the user's current location

- [x] Add orange markers to the map for each audio pin
- [x] When marker is tapped, open AudioPlaybackModal with pin details
- [x] Create AudioPlaybackModal with play/pause/stop controls
- [x] Add real-time progress bar and time display during playback
- [x] Add visual feedback with loading states and error handling
- [x] Implement automatic pin refresh when location changes
- [x] Add comprehensive loading indicators for all operations

### 🧪 POLISH + BUG FIXES (16–22 hrs)
- [ ] Handle case: user denies location or mic permission (show message or fallback)
- [ ] Handle login failures or missing user sessions
- [ ] Prevent uploading empty recordings
- [ ] Avoid dropping multiple pins on the same location repeatedly
- [ ] Show toast or alert on successful upload or failure
- [ ] Validate file formats and length (max 30s recording, for example)
