## 📝 Discovered During Work
### 🎨 UI/UX Improvements
- [x] **Create Landing Page** (2024-12-26): Build a beautiful landing screen with app logo, feature highlights, and navigation to auth - similar to "Locked In" design but themed for Memo app ✅ COMPLETE
- [x] **Bottom Navigation Implementation** (2024-12-26): Added Instagram/Snapchat-style bottom navigation with Friends, Map, and Profile screens with emoji icons ✅ COMPLETE
- [x] **Voice Recording Modal** (2024-12-26): Created beautiful Voice Memos-style recording interface with 30-second limit, play/pause controls, and smooth animations ✅ COMPLETE
- [x] **Fix Location Services Flash** (2024-12-26): Fixed the brief flash of "location services are disabled" message when navigating to map screen by adding initializing state to prevent UI race condition ✅ COMPLETE
- [x] **Enhanced Profile Screen** (2024-12-26): Completely redesigned profile screen with user stats (pin count, discoveries), list of user's audio pins with location names via reverse geocoding, and integrated audio playback functionality ✅ COMPLETE
- [x] **Improve Record Button Layout** (2024-12-26): Moved red recording button closer to navigation bar and removed blue location pin button for cleaner UI design ✅ COMPLETE
- [x] **Fix Audio Duration Display** (2024-12-26): Fixed the "0:00" duration issue by properly passing recording duration from VoiceRecordingModal to MapScreen and ensuring it's saved to the database. Added better time formatting and improved error handling ✅ COMPLETE
- [x] **Swipe-to-Delete Audio Pins** (2024-12-26): Implemented swipe-to-delete functionality for audio pins in ProfileScreen with smooth animations, confirmation dialog, and proper cleanup from both database and map state ✅ COMPLETE
- [x] **Neutral Color Scheme Update** (2024-12-26): Completely updated the app's color palette from the original warm teal/orange theme to a clean, modern neutral black and white theme. Updated all screens (ProfileScreen, MapScreen, FriendsScreen, LandingScreen), modals (VoiceRecordingModal, AudioPlaybackModal), components (MainApp navigation, AuthForm), authentication pages (sign-up/sign-in), loading indicators, and the main App.tsx to use pure black (#000000), pure white (#FFFFFF), and neutral grays for a timeless, professional aesthetic. Also updated PLANNING.md with the new color guidelines ✅ COMPLETE
- [x] **Enhanced Swipe-to-Delete UX** (2024-12-26): Improved swipe gesture functionality with smoother finger tracking, better threshold detection (reduced to 80px), click-outside-to-reset functionality, and proper state management. Fixed duration display to show actual recording length instead of "--:--" by implementing robust audio duration detection during playback. Added better visual feedback during swipe operations ✅ COMPLETE
- [x] **Fixed Swipe Reset Issues** (2024-12-26): Resolved issues where pins wouldn't reset to normal state when clicking outside or after audio playback. Implemented proper touch handling with ScrollView onTouchStart to reset all swipes when clicking outside pin areas. Fixed duration display to show "0:00" instead of "Loading..." for better UX. Added automatic swipe reset when audio playback stops. Improved overall swipe gesture reliability and user experience ✅ COMPLETE
- [x] **Enhanced Audio Playback Controls** (2024-12-26): Implemented proper play/pause button toggling with correct state management. Added isPaused state to track pause vs stop states. Fixed button display logic to show pause (⏸︎) when playing and play (▶) when paused. Added auto-reset functionality that returns audio to 0:00 when playback finishes. Implemented global touch handler that resets audio playback when clicking anywhere on screen. Enhanced progress bar to show during both playing and paused states. Improved overall audio control user experience ✅ COMPLETE
